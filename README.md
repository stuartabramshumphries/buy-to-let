# buy-to-let
simple program - attempt to simulate growth of
a btl portfolio give different situations
e.g. interest rates, growth rates, deposit etc
also tries to calculate what the effective rate of return over this time period

to improve I'd like to add a range of variables (different interest rates/yields/growth rates) and also to graph results
